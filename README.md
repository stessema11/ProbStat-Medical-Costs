# Medical Costs Exploratory Data Analysis

A script in Python 3 to show the relationship between age, gender, BMI, number of children, region, and whether a person smokes, and the individulal medical costs billed by health insurance.

This script generates a pdf titled `medical_costs.pdf` that contains all plots generated by running the script.

### Running the script

Go to the directory of the project in the command prompt

Before running the script, ensure that all necessary packages are installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run the script, run `python medical_costs.py` or `python3 medical_costs.py` in the command window

## Machine Learning

To pick which models we wanted to use to predict charges, we found a chart by SciKit (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/) that we followed to suggest that the following machine learning estimators be used:
- Linear Regression
- Lasso
- ElasticNet
- RidgeRegression
- RandomForestRegressor
